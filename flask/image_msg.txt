Take the image from the folder where it is stored and The .resize() method resizes the image to the specified dimensions of 224 pixels in width and 224 pixels in height.
Error level analysis involves analyzing the compression levels of different parts of an image to determine if it has been manipulated. When an image is edited, the compression levels in different parts of the image may not match, which can be detected through error level analysis.
Loading a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model involves restoring the saved weights and architecture of a trained model for prediction.
The steps involved include preprocessing the image by resizing it to the input size expected by the CNN model and normalizing the pixel values, loading the saved weights and architecture of the trained CNN model, passing the preprocessed image through the CNN model using the predict() method to obtain the class probabilities, and interpreting the prediction by identifying the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.
